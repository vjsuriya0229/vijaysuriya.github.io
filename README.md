I am Vijay Suriya, a development practitioner passionate about working with coastal and rural communities. Coming from an agricultural family in Sivagangai district, I have grown up with values of humility, empathy, and hard work.

With a PG Diploma in Development Management and hands-on experience with DHAN Foundation, I support fishermen federations, youth groups, and vulnerable households in building resilience.

I believe that true development happens when knowledge, community ownership, and nature come together. Outside work, I find joy in exploring new places, meeting people, and writing reflective poetry. 

- Work & Projects
My work focuses on strengthening communities through ecological restoration, climate awareness, and livelihood development. Some of my key areas include:

Mangrove and Wetland Restoration: Supporting conservation efforts in Point Calimere through community engagement, waterbody restoration, and awareness creation.

Fishermen Livelihood Studies: Understanding fishing practices, value chains, and challenges to design better support systems.

Climate Literacy: Conducting awareness sessions for schools, youth, and coastal communities on climate change and resilience.

Water & Ecology Projects: Exploring agroforestry models, sand dune conservation, groundwater recharge, and turtle nesting zone protection.

My approach blends field learning, institutional values, and the strengths of the people I work with.
